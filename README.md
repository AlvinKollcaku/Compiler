## Introduction
This Compiler turns the "Simple" but powerful language with 10 keywords into an assembly-like Simple Machine Language (SML). The project consists of three main parts:

1. **The Virtual Machine: Simpletron (SML folder)**
   - Simpletron is a virtual machine that runs programs written in SML.
   - It handles all information in terms of **words**, which are signed 5-digit decimal numbers (e.g., +10999).
   - Simpletron has a 1000-word memory, with each word referenced by locations 0 through 999.
   - Each SML instruction occupies one word of Simpletron's memory. The first two digits are the operation code, and the last three digits correspond to the memory location for the operation.
   - Example: `10999` means **READ** a value from the user and store it in location 999.
   - For detailed operation codes, see `SML/SML.txt`.

2. **Infix to Postfix Converter**
   - Converts complex infix expressions (e.g., `2+3`) into postfix (e.g., `2 3 +`) to be evaluated in SML.
   - Postfix expressions are converted to SML instructions using a stack-based evaluation.
   - Operators supported: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `%`, `^`.
   - Example conversion: `2.3 + 22 * (2^2 % 3) * 22.75` becomes `2.3 22 2 2 ^ 3 % * 22.75 * +`.
   - Floating point numbers are allowed, and the range [-99999, 99999] must be respected.

3. **The Compiler**
   - Converts each instruction in the **Simple** language into **SML**.
   - The Simple language includes commands: `rem`, `input`, `inputS`, `let`, `letS`, `print`, `goto`, `if..goto`, and `end`.
   - Operators in Simple have the same precedence as in C, and parentheses can change the order of evaluation.

### Compiler Passes
1. **First Pass**
   - Constructs a symbol table with every line number, variable name, numerical constant, and string literal.
   - Produces the corresponding SML instruction for each Simple statement.
   - Performs **error checking** (Explained below).

2. **Second Pass**
   - Completes unfinished instructions and outputs the SML program to a file.
   - Example: Resolving `goto 60` if line 60 has not yet been reached in the first pass.
   - 
## Further Details
- For a complete explanation of operation codes, see `SML/SML.txt`.

## Error Handling
In each error case the line number where it occurred is shown.
1) The form of each statement is validated. The following error messages can be shown:
   Invalid keyword: ![carbon (1)](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/febdcc96-c1a1-4ae3-a70a-bc3278c90de4)
   Missing goto in if statement: ![carbon](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/d764709b-0706-46b1-8f6b-70a92e619131)
2) Line numbers should be >= 0 . The following error message will be shown:
   ![carbon (1)](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/977bd160-92a7-4951-8185-05c51b7152d7)
3) String literals should include no spaces and should each be writen in "" seperately. Example: "I am" and "I " "am" is wrong while "I" "am" is correct.They must be less than 11 chars since memory is very limited. Error message:
   ![carbon](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/d6accd13-a7c8-4dbe-a11e-35f71b66d73f)
4) Overflow errors:
   ![carbon (1)](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/1822e34c-e8e1-4544-99db-e8e466a73e17)
   If during calculations the range [-99999,99999] is exceeded that is reported at runtime:
   ![carbon](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/137c61dc-9a83-40f2-98ca-934f289c30b4)
5) Divide by 0 attempts:
   ![carbon (1)](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/5797205f-474d-4c51-9d43-889af7e04b54)
6) A variable must not exceed length of 25 chars and must include only letters:
   ![carbon](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/950c9ab2-a8e3-40db-919b-89b2b260e1ce)
   ![carbon](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/36183fe4-d868-4e82-af1d-ea58898993e0)
7)Numbers must not be longer than 19 characters
   ![carbon (1)](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/6f42e9c2-efcb-4ff4-a847-e006de4ee782)
8)If the Simple program is too exceeds the 1000 word memory of SML an error will be thrown.
   ![carbon](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/3be0269c-c7db-48a0-a1ec-30d7872577b1)

-Logical errors will lead to undefined behaviour(e.g. using let instead of lets to initialze a string variable).

## Demo Program

Some programs showcasing the power of the Simple language can be found in the Programs folder. For example, **HighestGrade.txt** demonstrates all features of the language. Below, I explain a shorter program to illustrate how execution works:

### Symbol Table

| Symbol   | Type | Location |
|----------|------|----------|
| 0        | L    | 0        |
| "Enter"  | S    | 999      |
| "a"      | S    | 994      |
| "number" | S    | 993      |
| 1        | L    | 4        |
| number   | V    | 987      |
| 2        | L    | 5        |
| 2.00     | C    | 986      |
| 0.00     | C    | 984      |
| 3        | L    | 11       |
| "Odd"    | S    | 983      |
| 4        | L    | 12       |
| 5        | L    | 13       |
| "Even"   | S    | 980      |
| 6        | L    | 14       |

This table organizes the symbols used in the program, categorizing them by their type (L for line number, S for string, V for variable, and C for constant) and their respective memory locations. Each entry corresponds to an element utilized in the Simple language program described earlier.

### Explanation

This program demonstrates basic flow control in the Simple language. Here's a breakdown of its functionality:

- **Printing Strings**: Lines 0-2 use the `print` keyword to output multiple strings: "Enter", "a", "number", followed by a newline (NL).
- **Input**: Line 1 uses the `input` keyword to prompt the user for a numerical input, which is stored in the variable `number`.
- **Conditional Branching**: Line 2 checks if the value stored in `number` is even (`number % 2 == 0`). If true, the program jumps to line 5; otherwise, it continues to line 3.
- **Output Based on Condition**: 
  - If `number` is even, line 5 prints "Even".
  - If `number` is odd, line 3 prints "Odd".
- **End of Program**: Line 6 marks the end of the program execution.

The symbol table provides a structured view of all symbols used in the program, including line numbers, variables (`number`), constants (`2.00`, `0.00`), and string literals (`"Enter"`, `"Odd"`, `"Even"`). Each symbol is categorized by type and mapped to its corresponding memory location, facilitating efficient compilation into the Simple Machine Language (SML).

The corresponding SML program executes these operations in a simulated environment, reflecting the sequence of actions defined in the Simple language program.
