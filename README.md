## Introduction
This Compiler turns the "Simple" but powerful language with 10 keywords into an assembly-like Simple Machine Language (SML). The project consists of three main parts:

1. **The Virtual Machine: Simpletron (SML folder)**
   - Simpletron is a virtual machine that runs programs written in SML.
   - It handles all information in terms of **words**, which are signed 5-digit decimal numbers (e.g., +10999).
   - Simpletron has a 1000-word memory, with each word referenced by locations 0 through 999.
   - Each SML instruction occupies one word of Simpletron's memory. The first two digits are the operation code, and the last three digits correspond to the memory location for the operation.
   - Example: `10999` means **READ** a value from the user and store it in location 999.
   - For detailed operation codes, see `SML/SML.txt`.

2. **Infix to Postfix Converter**
   - Converts complex infix expressions (e.g., `2+3`) into postfix (e.g., `2 3 +`) to be evaluated in SML.
   - Postfix expressions are converted to SML instructions using a stack-based evaluation.
   - Operators supported: `+`, `-`, `/`, `*`, `%`, `^`.
   - Example conversion: `2.3 + 22 * (2^2 % 3) * 22.75` becomes `2.3 22 2 2 ^ 3 % * 22.75 * +`.
   - Floating point numbers are allowed, and the range [-99999, 99999] must be respected.

3. **The Compiler**
   - Converts each instruction in the **Simple** language into **SML**.
   - The Simple language includes commands: `rem`, `input`, `inputS`, `let`, `letS`, `print`, `goto`, `if..goto`, and `end`.
   - Operators in Simple have the same precedence as in C, and parentheses can change the order of evaluation.

### Compiler Passes
1. **First Pass**
   - Constructs a symbol table with every line number, variable name, numerical constant, and string literal.
   - Produces the corresponding SML instruction for each Simple statement.
   - Performs **error checking** (Explained below).

2. **Second Pass**
   - Completes unfinished instructions and outputs the SML program to a file.
   - Example: Resolving `goto 60` if line 60 has not yet been reached in the first pass.

## Error Handling
In each error case the line number where it occurred is shown.
1) The form of each statement is validated. The following error messages can be shown:
   Invalid keyword: ![carbon (1)](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/febdcc96-c1a1-4ae3-a70a-bc3278c90de4)
   Missing goto in if statement: ![carbon](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/d764709b-0706-46b1-8f6b-70a92e619131)
2) Line numbers should be >= 0 . The following error message will be shown:
   ![carbon (1)](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/977bd160-92a7-4951-8185-05c51b7152d7)
3) String literals should include no spaces and should each be writen in "" seperately. Example: "I am" and "I " "am" is wrong while "I" "am" is correct.They must be less than 11 chars since memory is very limited. Error message:
   ![carbon](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/d6accd13-a7c8-4dbe-a11e-35f71b66d73f)
4) Overflow errors:
   ![carbon (1)](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/1822e34c-e8e1-4544-99db-e8e466a73e17)
   If during calculations the range [-99999,99999] is exceeded that is reported at runtime:
   ![carbon](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/137c61dc-9a83-40f2-98ca-934f289c30b4)
5) Divide by 0 attempts:

6) A variable must not exceed length of 25 chars and must include only letters:
   ![carbon](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/950c9ab2-a8e3-40db-919b-89b2b260e1ce)

7)Numbers must not be longer than 19 characters
   ![carbon (1)](https://github.com/AlvinKollcaku/Compiler/assets/142890850/6f42e9c2-efcb-4ff4-a847-e006de4ee782)

- Logical errors will lead to undefined behaviour(e.g. using let instead of lets to initialze a string variable).

Explanation
Everything is put into the symbol table. Variables are placed at the back of memory, starting at 999. The first variable is "Enter", which occupies 5 characters, so the next free spot is 994.

While adding tokens to the symbol table, the compiler also generates the SML instructions. For the first line, after inserting the line number 0, the compiler encounters the print keyword, indicating that everything after it must be output to the screen. This is done using the operation code 13 + location for each token. The first three SML instructions use operation code 13, corresponding to the three string literals in the first print statement.

Upon reaching the if statement, the compiler converts each side into postfix notation for evaluation using SML. Thus, number % 2 == 0 becomes number 2 % == 0. To evaluate the left part, the number is loaded into an accumulator (a special register for algebraic operations) using 20=LOAD + location of number. The corresponding instruction to perform number % 2 is written in SML, and the result is stored in the next free variable location. The right side is similarly processed (in this case, no postfix conversion is needed). Finally, the left value is loaded into the accumulator, and the right value is subtracted. If the accumulator is zero, the program branches to instruction 13; otherwise, it continues with the next instruction.
