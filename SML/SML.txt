The simple language contains:
-Accumulator -> a special register in which info is put before Simple language uses it
                in calculations or examines it

-A word -> 4 digit signed decimal number
-A word=SimpleLanguage Instruction
        First 2 digits = operation code -> specify operation to be performed
        Last 2 digits = operand -> Memory location to do the operation on
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Operation Code  -> Meaning

Input/Output
READ 10 -> Read a word(representing a value) from keyboard into specific memory location
WRITE 11 -> Write a word from a specific location in memory to the screen
READ_STRING 12
WRITE_STRING 13

NEWLINE 14 -> prints a newline

Load/Store operations
LOAD 20 -> Load a word from a specific location in memory into the accumulator
STORE 21 -> Store a word from the accumulator into a specific location in memory

Arithmetic operations
ADD 30 -> Add a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator
            (the result is left in the accumulator)
SUBTRACT 31 -> SUBTRACT a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator
            (the result is left in the accumulator)
DIVIDE 32 -> DIVIDE a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator
            (the result is left in the accumulator)
MULTIPLY 33 -> MULTIPLY a word from a specific location in memory to the word in the accumulator
            (the result is left in the accumulator)
REMAINDER 34 -> Value in accumulator % a word in specific memory location
                (the result is left in the accumulator)
EXPONENTIATION 35->Value in accumulator ^ a word in specific memory location
                                   (the result is left in the accumulator)

Transfer-of-control operations:
BRANCH 40 -> Branch to a specific location in memory
BRANCHNEG 41 -> Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is negative
BRANCHNEG_ZERO 42 -> Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero or negative
BRANCHPOS 43 -> Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is positive
BRANCHPOS_ZERO 44 -> Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero or positive
BRANCHZERO 45 -> Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is zero
BRANCHNOT_ZERO 46 -> -> Branch to a specific location in memory if the accumulator is not zero
HALT 43 -> Halt the program

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There are 4 registers used in the language simulator
accumulator
instructionCounter - will hold the current instruction number
instructionRegister - will hold the current instruction (operationCode + operand)
operationCode - will hold the first 2 digits of the instruction being executed
operand - will hold the last 2 digits of the instruction being executed

1)Before running SML program we load it into memory
